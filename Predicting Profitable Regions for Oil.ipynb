Here is how each region fares against this break-even point, taking into account the actual production data:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Region 0: With a profit of 33,591,411 dollars this region indicates a substantial margin above the break-even point. Given that the total budget for thr egion was 100 million (covering 200 wells), and the profit achieved is significantly high, it implies that the average well production far exceeded the break even reserve requirement. From the 100 million dollar investment this would indicate a 33.59 percet ROI (return on investment)\n",

    "        - Region 2: With a profit of 25,985,717 this region also shows positive returns, but similar to Region 1, suggests that a significant number of wells might be producing just around or somehwat above the break even point. The profit although robust is not as significant as region 0.\n",

    "    - Recommendation: If maximizing profit is the primary goal and the company is ready to tolerate higher risks, Region 0 appears to be promising.
